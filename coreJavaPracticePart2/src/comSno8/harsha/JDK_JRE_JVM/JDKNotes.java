	 * JDK inside JRE inside JVM

	 * JDK is outerLayer
	 * JDK & JRE are TOOLS
	 * JVM -> You can't install explicitly 
	 * 
	 *  if you want JVM need to install JRE
	 *  
	 *  IF We need JRE only, so no need of install JDK
	 *   -> AtLeast 1.8 the process is their.
	 *   -> After 1.8 JRE can't install explicitly

	 * JDK-> To develop the java program or application that entire thing in JDK , Along with JRE
	 * JRE-> JRE provide like an earth to JDK
	 * JDK need JRE environment 
	 * Human need earth environment
	 * like water, light, air
	 * 
	 * Javac only inside the JDK so that we have compile we get .ClassFile only need for developer
	 * To run the program you don't need Javac
	 * 
	 * To compile any program you have to set the environment variable
	 * we have mention the compilation software and have to say to system
	 * that is available at JDK inside bin folder (i.e Javac)
	 * 
	 * inside
	 * ******
	 * JDK -> Bin folder
	 * we have entire development related software available so that we add or attached path to environment variable
