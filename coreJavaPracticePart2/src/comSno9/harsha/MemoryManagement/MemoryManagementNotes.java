	 *  ******
	 *  1.What is memory management?
	 *  Ans: Memory manage is called Memory management
	 *  	-->Software background is Memory
	 *  	-->Computer world memory
	 *  		-->RAM (Temporary)
	 *  		-->ROM - Internal memory or Hard disk [permanent]
	 *  
	 *  -->Temporary Storage [RAM USING]
	 *  
	 *   Temporary handling is a file 
	 *   EX: Resume
	 *   
	 *   word doc entire information stored in temporary storage before when you save it in word document
	 *   
	 *   At certain instance of time it store when your power cut will
	 *   
	 *Every operation done by JVM it require memory Management
	 *Whenever java installed then They will allocate some amount of memory
	 *
	 *For efficient use they allocate they create memory space's or area's
	 *Efficient use
	 *-> SomeArea for
	 *		Temporary access
	 *-> SomeArea for
	 *		Frequent access
	 *-> SomeArea for
	 *		LongTime access
	 *
	 *Which kind of memory they allocated
	 *
	 *We divided into part's this is called Memory Area
	 *
	 *for EX;
	 *		10 acrea's of land to cultivate 
	 *		divided into
	 *		used for efficient farming
